As an assistive technology user
I want to be able to use tabbing navigation in wepages
So that I can navigate with no use of mouse devices

Scenario 1 - Find and click the dog link showed next (image_links - Task3)
Given
    I go to "http://watinha.com/pyccuracy_test_1/templates/image_links/task3.html"
    And I wait for the page to load
When
    I tab navigate to "Dog" element
    And I press enter
Then
    I wait for the page to load
    I see "Dog - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" title
